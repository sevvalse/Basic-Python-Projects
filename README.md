# Basic-Python-Projects
 This repository contains simple projects I created during the process of learning and practicing the Python language. It aims to apply basic programming concepts and develop different problem solving techniques.

- **Basic Calculator**
  *  This Python program is a simple calculator that allows users to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division or exit the program. It runs in an infinite loop, showing a menu and prompting the user for input. The program validates user input, ensuring the divisor is not zero for division. If the user selects "5," the program exits with a "Goodbye!" message. Invalid choices prompt the user to enter a valid option. The program continues running until the user decides to exit.
- **Factorial Function**
  * This program calculates the factorial of a given number. It runs in an infinite loop to repeatedly prompt the user for input. If the entered number is negative, the program displays an error message and asks for a new input, as factorials are not defined for negative numbers. For valid input (0 or positive), the program calculates the factorial by multiplying numbers from 1 to the given number and displays the result. The loop exits after computing and displaying the factorial.
- **GPA Manager**
  * This Python application provides a simple user management system using an SQLite database. Users can log in, update grades (midterm or final), and view grades along with GPA calculations. The program supports adding new users, authenticating them with passwords, and managing their academic data. It serves as a practical project for learning database operations and user authentication.
