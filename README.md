### **2. Factorial Calculator**

This program calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer. It prompts the user for a number and handles invalid inputs (negative numbers). The calculation is performed using a `for` loop.

**Topics Covered:**
* Loops (`while`, `for`)
* Basic I/O operations
* Error handling

### **3. To-Do List Application**

This is a command-line to-do list application that allows users to manage their tasks. Users can add, list, delete, and mark tasks as completed. The program uses a list of dictionaries to store tasks and provides a clear, menu-driven interface.

**Topics Covered:**
* Lists and dictionaries
* Functions
* User interaction
* Menu-driven design

### **4. Basic Calculator**

This program is a simple command-line calculator that performs four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It presents a menu for the user to select an operation and handles division by zero and invalid menu choices.

**Topics Covered:**
* Loops
* Conditional statements
* Basic arithmetic operations
* User input validation
